	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// treeCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	treeCmd.PersistentFlags().BoolP("data", "d", false, "Display /data/ paths instead of the plain path")
}
